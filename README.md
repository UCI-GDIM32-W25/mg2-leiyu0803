## Devlog

In the GameController, I created a timer to spawn the coin,which is same to the plan, and add a 10% chance to spawn multiple coin in the same time.

In the Coin, I make them to move left.

In the Player, I added a collision detection with ground to limit the player's jump. This part is not in the plan. I call the Score function of GameController in the Player, which is planned to call in the Coin. I use AddForce to make player jump.
